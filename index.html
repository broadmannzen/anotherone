      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Civil Engineering student at the prestigious Vaal University of Technology in South Africa, passionate about designing and constructing safe, efficient, and forward-thinking structures.  
        Beyond engineering, I am a Google IT Support Professional and a certified Web Developer from Michigan University, equipping me with expertise in problem-solving, technology, and digital innovation.  
        Additionally, I have completed a Computer Science course at Harvard University, strengthening my foundation in computational thinking, algorithms, and software development.  
        With a diverse skill set spanning engineering, IT, and web development, I thrive on tackling complex challenges, optimizing systems, and delivering impactful solutions across multiple domains.  
        Whether it’s designing infrastructure, troubleshooting technical issues, or crafting cutting-edge applications, I bring a solutions-driven mindset and a relentless passion for innovation.  
        After all, problem-solving is my key, and I’m always ready to hand out a spare. Now, if only I could unlock the perfect chess strategy—or maybe even FIFA instead. For the love of the game!
